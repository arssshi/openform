# mellow / Edition 02

> Take the day as it comes.

## Soft-focus optimism

Rounded sunburst ceramics, grooved color bands, hand-friendly shapes, and delightfully plump serif lettering. Nostalgia becomes an optimistic, useful everyday system.

An easygoing identity for home goods and good moods. A soft four-point sparkle, warm peach fields, and wonderfully chunky type recall the optimism of a slower era.

## A complete, usable visual world

This identity includes an individually authored master symbol, real font files, original illustration, art-directed campaign, composed identity board, stationery, packaging, web direction, icon sheet, and a complete working theme. The illustrations and applications are original vector artwork, not photographs or official assets of an existing company.

Start by opening **reference.html** and **components.html**. They are working local pages, not screenshots. Open identity-board.svg for the full visual system. To apply the design to an existing project, read INSTALL.md or give a coding model AI-PROMPT.md.

## Personality

Relaxed, affectionate, and gently funny.

## The distinguishing decisions

1. Sparkles use soft inward curves, never sharp straight spokes.
2. Keep backgrounds warm and use mulberry to anchor the composition.
3. Set short, chunky headlines with tight spacing and spacious supporting copy.

4. Peach centered hero with chunky Fraunces lettering and a grooved sunburst. Mulberry controls, butter-colored rounded cards, and a relaxed sectional rhythm.
5. Use the supplied grooved-sunburst artwork as the principal visual device. Do not substitute an unrelated stock image or a generic gradient.
6. Keep informational reading areas calm and aligned even where the campaign is expressive.

## Logo system

- lockup.svg: primary symbol-and-wordmark configuration.
- wordmark.svg: independent typographic wordmark.
- mark.svg: compact master symbol; useful for avatars, corners, and interface accents.
- monochrome.svg: genuine single-color version.
- favicon.svg and avatar.svg: ready-sized applications.

All artwork typography is outlined. The artwork renders correctly without installed fonts or internet access. Keep clear space of at least half a symbol height around independent lockups; minimum recommended symbol width is 24px and lockup width is 160px. Never stretch glyphs or separately distort part of a mark. Intentional large crops belong in campaigns, not the primary logo file.

## Color roles

| Role | Name | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ink | Mulberry | #713F4A |
| Accent | Peach fuzz | #F0BA99 |
| Paper | Buttermilk | #FCEDCE |
| Support | Pistachio | #B7B885 |

### Approved normal-text combinations

- #713F4A on #F0BA99: 4.85:1, meets WCAG AA for normal text.
- #713F4A on #FCEDCE: 7.22:1, meets WCAG AA for normal text.

Support color is an illustration / decorative surface until its intended text pairing is independently checked. The theme uses approved primary pairs and an explicitly derived secondary reading color.

## Typography

- Display: Fraunces, weight 900, tracking -0.05em, leading 1.02.
- Reading: Outfit, weight 400, 16px, 1.7 leading, up to 65 characters per line.
- Accent: Fraunces, normal.
- Labels: 11px, 0.08em tracking, 1.5 leading.
- Maximum desktop display size: 96px. Use the provided CSS clamps on narrower screens.
- Keep the original, unmodified local font files and their original SIL OFL notices together.

## The layout grammar

Peach centered hero with chunky Fraunces lettering and a grooved sunburst. Mulberry controls, butter-colored rounded cards, and a relaxed sectional rhythm.

The page maximum width is 1220px. Gutters use clamp(20px, 4vw, 64px). Section spacing uses clamp(64px, 9vw, 128px). The base spacing unit is 4px. The desktop hero's text/image proportion is 50/50; centered compositions use a single wide column. At 960px the hero becomes one column. At 640px the card grid becomes one column and native mobile navigation becomes available.

## Components

The base radius is 26px; information cards use 0px corners and a quiet top divider. Borders are 1px; buttons follow the pill direction. Buttons are at least 48px high; inputs are 52px high. Controls keep a visible 3px focus outline with a 4px offset. Motion preferences are respected. Keep one clear focal idea per composition.

The class map and exact values live in theme.json. The live inventory in components.html includes real typography, controls, cards, badges, forms, tables, notices, and accordions. Optional components.tsx provides typed React primitives with no dependency beyond React.

The composed preview is supplementary to the 30 primary files; original font files and license notices are supplementary too. Counts do not include duplicate ZIP archives, repeated licenses, or per-font support files.

## Installing the theme

```sh
node install-theme.mjs --target "/path/to/your/project"
```

Load /themes/mellow/theme.css and attach data-openform="mellow" to the existing document root or desired subtree. Use the supplied of-* classes to apply the actual component system. Preserve your own content, routes, application state, and real form handlers.

### The instruction to give an AI coding assistant

Install the Openform "mellow" Edition 02 theme in this project. The complete downloaded kit is available locally. Read AI-PROMPT.md and theme.json, run install-theme.mjs against this project's root, then follow reference.html and components.html to apply the exact system across the site. Preserve the existing content, routes, data, and functionality.

AI-PROMPT.md contains concrete ordered steps, framework mappings, exact asset paths, component names, numeric constraints, and acceptance checks. It is written so a coding model with access to the kit can implement the provided design instead of guessing it.
