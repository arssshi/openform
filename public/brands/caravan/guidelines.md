# Caravan / Edition 02

> The long way is the good way.

## The long-road outfitter

Winding route illustrations, old road-sign geometry, stitched-looking badge frames, and sturdy condensed lettering. A practical travel world with a richly nostalgic landscape.

A wandering identity for a road-trip outfitter. A rolling pennant, burnt sienna, and sturdy vintage lettering bring practical adventure back into focus.

## A complete, usable visual world

This identity includes an individually authored master symbol, real font files, original illustration, art-directed campaign, composed identity board, stationery, packaging, web direction, icon sheet, and a complete working theme. The illustrations and applications are original vector artwork, not photographs or official assets of an existing company.

Start by opening **reference.html** and **components.html**. They are working local pages, not screenshots. Open identity-board.svg for the full visual system. To apply the design to an existing project, read INSTALL.md or give a coding model AI-PROMPT.md.

## Personality

Spirited, practical, and delightfully nostalgic.

## The distinguishing decisions

1. The pennant always points right and uses the full-height mast.
2. Frame display headlines with badge-like rules and a small route label.
3. Use roadside teal sparingly against the warm main palette.

4. Desert hero with condensed road-sign headings and a layered landscape. Leather outlines, teal route accents, and badge-like equipment labels.
5. Use the supplied desert-route artwork as the principal visual device. Do not substitute an unrelated stock image or a generic gradient.
6. Keep informational reading areas calm and aligned even where the campaign is expressive.

## Logo system

- lockup.svg: primary symbol-and-wordmark configuration.
- wordmark.svg: independent typographic wordmark.
- mark.svg: compact master symbol; useful for avatars, corners, and interface accents.
- monochrome.svg: genuine single-color version.
- favicon.svg and avatar.svg: ready-sized applications.

All artwork typography is outlined. The artwork renders correctly without installed fonts or internet access. Keep clear space of at least half a symbol height around independent lockups; minimum recommended symbol width is 24px and lockup width is 160px. Never stretch glyphs or separately distort part of a mark. Intentional large crops belong in campaigns, not the primary logo file.

## Color roles

| Role | Name | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ink | Leather | #5B3424 |
| Accent | Desert | #E6A871 |
| Paper | Route map | #F5E8CC |
| Support | Roadside | #498E82 |

### Approved normal-text combinations

- #5B3424 on #E6A871: 5.2:1, meets WCAG AA for normal text.
- #5B3424 on #F5E8CC: 8.82:1, meets WCAG AA for normal text.

Support color is an illustration / decorative surface until its intended text pairing is independently checked. The theme uses approved primary pairs and an explicitly derived secondary reading color.

## Typography

- Display: Bebas Neue, weight 400, tracking 0.04em, leading 1.02.
- Reading: Lora, weight 400, 16px, 1.7 leading, up to 65 characters per line.
- Accent: Lora, normal.
- Labels: 11px, 0.08em tracking, 1.5 leading.
- Maximum desktop display size: 96px. Use the provided CSS clamps on narrower screens.
- Keep the original, unmodified local font files and their original SIL OFL notices together.

## The layout grammar

Desert hero with condensed road-sign headings and a layered landscape. Leather outlines, teal route accents, and badge-like equipment labels.

The page maximum width is 1320px. Gutters use clamp(20px, 4vw, 64px). Section spacing uses clamp(64px, 9vw, 128px). The base spacing unit is 4px. The desktop hero's text/image proportion is 49/51; centered compositions use a single wide column. At 960px the hero becomes one column. At 640px the card grid becomes one column and native mobile navigation becomes available.

## Components

The base radius is 10px; information cards use 0px corners and a quiet top divider. Borders are 2px; buttons follow the soft direction. Buttons are at least 48px high; inputs are 52px high. Controls keep a visible 3px focus outline with a 4px offset. Motion preferences are respected. Keep one clear focal idea per composition.

The class map and exact values live in theme.json. The live inventory in components.html includes real typography, controls, cards, badges, forms, tables, notices, and accordions. Optional components.tsx provides typed React primitives with no dependency beyond React.

The composed preview is supplementary to the 30 primary files; original font files and license notices are supplementary too. Counts do not include duplicate ZIP archives, repeated licenses, or per-font support files.

## Installing the theme

```sh
node install-theme.mjs --target "/path/to/your/project"
```

Load /themes/caravan/theme.css and attach data-openform="caravan" to the existing document root or desired subtree. Use the supplied of-* classes to apply the actual component system. Preserve your own content, routes, application state, and real form handlers.

### The instruction to give an AI coding assistant

Install the Openform "Caravan" Edition 02 theme in this project. The complete downloaded kit is available locally. Read AI-PROMPT.md and theme.json, run install-theme.mjs against this project's root, then follow reference.html and components.html to apply the exact system across the site. Preserve the existing content, routes, data, and functionality.

AI-PROMPT.md contains concrete ordered steps, framework mappings, exact asset paths, component names, numeric constraints, and acceptance checks. It is written so a coding model with access to the kit can implement the provided design instead of guessing it.
